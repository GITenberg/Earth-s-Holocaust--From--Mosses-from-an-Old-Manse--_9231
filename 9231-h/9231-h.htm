    <p>
      Once upon a time&mdash;but whether in the time past or time to come is a
      matter of little or no moment&mdash;this wide world had become so
      overburdened with an accumulation of worn-out trumpery, that the
      inhabitants determined to rid themselves of it by a general bonfire. The
      site fixed upon at the representation of the insurance companies, and as
      being as central a spot as any other on the globe, was one of the broadest
      prairies of the West, where no human habitation would be endangered by the
      flames, and where a vast assemblage of spectators might commodiously
      admire the show. Having a taste for sights of this kind, and imagining,
      likewise, that the illumination of the bonfire might reveal some
      profundity of moral truth heretofore hidden in mist or darkness, I made it
      convenient to journey thither and be present. At my arrival, although the
      heap of condemned rubbish was as yet comparatively small, the torch had
      already been applied. Amid that boundless plain, in the dusk of the
      evening, like a far off star alone in the firmament, there was merely
      visible one tremulous gleam, whence none could have anticipated so fierce
      a blaze as was destined to ensue. With every moment, however, there came
      foot-travellers, women holding up their aprons, men on horseback,
      wheelbarrows, lumbering baggage-wagons, and other vehicles, great and
      small, and from far and near, laden with articles that were judged fit for
      nothing but to be burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What materials have been used to kindle the flame?&rdquo; inquired I of a
      bystander; for I was desirous of knowing the whole process of the affair
      from beginning to end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person whom I addressed was a grave man, fifty years old or
      thereabout, who had evidently come thither as a looker-on. He struck me
      immediately as having weighed for himself the true value of life and its
      circumstances, and therefore as feeling little personal interest in
      whatever judgment the world might form of them. Before answering my
      question, he looked me in the face by the kindling light of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, some very dry combustibles,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;and extremely suitable to
      the purpose,&mdash;no other, in fact, than yesterday&rsquo;s newspapers, last
      month&rsquo;s magazines, and last year&rsquo;s withered leaves. Here now comes some
      antiquated trash that will take fire like a handful of shavings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, some rough-looking men advanced to the verge of the bonfire,
      and threw in, as it appeared, all the rubbish of the herald&rsquo;s office,&mdash;the
      blazonry of coat armor, the crests and devices of illustrious families,
      pedigrees that extended back, like lines of light, into the mist of the
      dark ages, together with stars, garters, and embroidered collars, each of
      which, as paltry a bawble as it might appear to the uninstructed eye, had
      once possessed vast significance, and was still, in truth, reckoned among
      the most precious of moral or material facts by the worshippers of the
      gorgeous past. Mingled with this confused heap, which was tossed into the
      flames by armfuls at once, were innumerable badges of knighthood,
      comprising those of all the European sovereignties, and Napoleon&rsquo;s
      decoration of the Legion of Honor, the ribbons of which were entangled
      with those of the ancient order of St. Louis. There, too, were the medals
      of our own Society of Cincinnati, by means of which, as history tells us,
      an order of hereditary knights came near being constituted out of the king
      quellers of the Revolution. And besides, there were the patents of
      nobility of German counts and barons, Spanish grandees, and English peers,
      from the worm-eaten instruments signed by William the Conqueror down to
      the bran-new parchment of the latest lord who has received his honors from
      the fair hand of Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of the dense volumes of smoke, mingled with vivid jets of flame,
      that gushed and eddied forth from this immense pile of earthly
      distinctions, the multitude of plebeian spectators set up a joyous shout,
      and clapped their hands with an emphasis that made the welkin echo. That
      was their moment of triumph, achieved, after long ages, over creatures of
      the same clay and the same spiritual infirmities, who had dared to assume
      the privileges due only to Heaven&rsquo;s better workmanship. But now there
      rushed towards the blazing heap a gray-haired man, of stately presence,
      wearing a coat, from the breast of which a star, or other badge of rank,
      seemed to have been forcibly wrenched away. He had not the tokens of
      intellectual power in his face; but still there was the demeanor, the
      habitual and almost native dignity, of one who had been born to the idea
      of his own social superiority, and had never felt it questioned till that
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People,&rdquo; cried he, gazing at the ruin of what was dearest to his eyes
      with grief and wonder, but nevertheless with a degree of stateliness,&mdash;&ldquo;people,
      what have you done? This fire is consuming all that marked your advance
      from barbarism, or that could have prevented your relapse thither. We, the
      men of the privileged orders, were those who kept alive from age to age
      the old chivalrous spirit; the gentle and generous thought; the higher,
      the purer, the more refined and delicate life. With the nobles, too, you
      cast off the poet, the painter, the sculptor,&mdash;all the beautiful
      arts; for we were their patrons, and created the atmosphere in which they
      flourish. In abolishing the majestic distinctions of rank, society loses
      not only its grace, but its steadfastness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More he would doubtless have spoken; but here there arose an outcry,
      sportive, contemptuous, and indignant, that altogether drowned the appeal
      of the fallen nobleman, insomuch that, casting one look of despair at his
      own half-burned pedigree, he shrunk back into the crowd, glad to shelter
      himself under his new-found insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him thank his stars that we have not flung him into the same fire!&rdquo;
       shouted a rude figure, spurning the embers with his foot. &ldquo;And henceforth
      let no man dare to show a piece of musty parchment as his warrant for
      lording it over his fellows. If he have strength of arm, well and good; it
      is one species of superiority. If he have wit, wisdom, courage, force of
      character, let these attributes do for him what they may; but from this
      day forward no mortal must hope for place and consideration by reckoning
      up the mouldy bones of his ancestors. That nonsense is done away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in good time,&rdquo; remarked the grave observer by my side, in a low
      voice, however, &ldquo;if no worse nonsense comes in its place; but, at all
      events, this species of nonsense has fairly lived out its life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was little space to muse or moralize over the embers of this
      time-honored rubbish; for, before it was half burned out, there came
      another multitude from beyond the sea, bearing the purple robes of
      royalty, and the crowns, globes, and sceptres of emperors and kings. All
      these had been condemned as useless bawbles, playthings at best, fit only
      for the infancy of the world or rods to govern and chastise it in its
      nonage, but with which universal manhood at its full-grown stature could
      no longer brook to be insulted. Into such contempt had these regal
      insignia now fallen that the gilded crown and tinselled robes of the
      player king from Drury Lane Theatre had been thrown in among the rest,
      doubtless as a mockery of his brother monarchs on the great stage of the
      world. It was a strange sight to discern the crown jewels of England
      glowing and flashing in the midst of the fire. Some of them had been
      delivered down from the time of the Saxon princes; others were purchased
      with vast revenues, or perchance ravished from the dead brows of the
      native potentates of Hindustan; and the whole now blazed with a dazzling
      lustre, as if a star had fallen in that spot and been shattered into
      fragments. The splendor of the ruined monarchy had no reflection save in
      those inestimable precious stones. But enough on this subject. It were but
      tedious to describe how the Emperor of Austria&rsquo;s mantle was converted to
      tinder, and how the posts and pillars of the French throne became a heap
      of coals, which it was impossible to distinguish from those of any other
      wood. Let me add, however, that I noticed one of the exiled Poles stirring
      up the bonfire with the Czar of Russia&rsquo;s sceptre, which he afterwards
      flung into the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The smell of singed garments is quite intolerable here,&rdquo; observed my new
      acquaintance, as the breeze enveloped us in the smoke of a royal wardrobe.
      &ldquo;Let us get to windward and see what they are doing on the other side of
      the bonfire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We accordingly passed around, and were just in time to witness the arrival
      of a vast procession of Washingtonians,&mdash;as the votaries of
      temperance call themselves nowadays,&mdash;accompanied by thousands of the
      Irish disciples of Father Mathew, with that great apostle at their head.
      They brought a rich contribution to the bonfire, being nothing less than
      all the hogsheads and barrels of liquor in the world, which they rolled
      before them across the prairie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my children,&rdquo; cried Father Mathew, when they reached the verge of
      the fire, &ldquo;one shove more, and the work is done. And now let us stand off
      and see Satan deal with his own liquor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, having placed their wooden vessels within reach of the
      flames, the procession stood off at a safe distance, and soon beheld them
      burst into a blaze that reached the clouds and threatened to set the sky
      itself on fire. And well it might; for here was the whole world&rsquo;s stock of
      spirituous liquors, which, instead of kindling a frenzied light in the
      eyes of individual topers as of yore, soared upwards with a bewildering
      gleam that startled all mankind. It was the aggregate of that fierce fire
      which would otherwise have scorched the hearts of millions. Meantime
      numberless bottles of precious wine were flung into the blaze, which
      lapped up the contents as if it loved them, and grew, like other
      drunkards, the merrier and fiercer for what it quaffed. Never again will
      the insatiable thirst of the fire-fiend be so pampered. Here were the
      treasures of famous bon vivants,&mdash;liquors that had been tossed on
      ocean, and mellowed in the sun, and hoarded long in the recesses of the
      earth,&mdash;the pale, the gold, the ruddy juice of whatever vineyards
      were most delicate,&mdash;the entire vintage of Tokay,&mdash;all mingling
      in one stream with the vile fluids of the common pot house, and
      contributing to heighten the self-same blaze. And while it rose in a
      gigantic spire that seemed to wave against the arch of the firmament and
      combine itself with the light of stars, the multitude gave a shout as if
      the broad earth were exulting in its deliverance from the curse of ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the joy was not universal. Many deemed that human life would be
      gloomier than ever when that brief illumination should sink down. While
      the reformers were at work I overheard muttered expostulations from
      several respectable gentlemen with red noses and wearing gouty shoes; and
      a ragged worthy, whose face looked like a hearth where the fire is burned
      out, now expressed his discontent more openly and boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this world good for,&rdquo; said the last toper, &ldquo;now that we can never
      be jolly any more? What is to comfort the poor man in sorrow and
      perplexity? How is he to keep his heart warm against the cold winds of
      this cheerless earth? And what do you propose to give him in exchange for
      the solace that you take away? How are old friends to sit together by the
      fireside without a cheerful glass between them? A plague upon your
      reformation! It is a sad world, a cold world, a selfish world, a low
      world, not worth an honest fellow&rsquo;s living in, now that good fellowship is
      gone forever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This harangue excited great mirth among the bystanders; but, preposterous
      as was the sentiment, I could not help commiserating the forlorn condition
      of the last toper, whose boon companions had dwindled away from his side,
      leaving the poor fellow without a soul to countenance him in sipping his
      liquor, nor indeed any liquor to sip. Not that this was quite the true
      state of the case; for I had observed him at a critical moment filch a
      bottle of fourth-proof brandy that fell beside the bonfire and hide it in
      his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirituous and fermented liquors being thus disposed of, the zeal of
      the reformers next induced them to replenish the fire with all the boxes
      of tea and bags of coffee in the world. And now came the planters of
      Virginia, bringing their crops of tobacco. These, being cast upon the heap
      of inutility, aggregated it to the size of a mountain, and incensed the
      atmosphere with such potent fragrance that methought we should never draw
      pure breath again. The present sacrifice seemed to startle the lovers of
      the weed more than any that they had hitherto witnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ve put my pipe out,&rdquo; said an old gentleman, flinging it into
      the flames in a pet. &ldquo;What is this world coming to? Everything rich and
      racy&mdash;all the spice of life&mdash;is to be condemned as useless. Now
      that they have kindled the bonfire, if these nonsensical reformers would
      fling themselves into it, all would be well enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be patient,&rdquo; responded a stanch conservative; &ldquo;it will come to that in
      the end. They will first fling us in, and finally themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the general and systematic measures of reform I now turn to consider
      the individual contributions to this memorable bonfire. In many instances
      these were of a very amusing character. One poor fellow threw in his empty
      purse, and another a bundle of counterfeit or insolvable bank-notes.
      Fashionable ladies threw in their last season&rsquo;s bonnets, together with
      heaps of ribbons, yellow lace, and much other half-worn milliner&rsquo;s ware,
      all of which proved even more evanescent in the fire than it had been in
      the fashion. A multitude of lovers of both sexes&mdash;discarded maids or
      bachelors and couples mutually weary of one another&mdash;tossed in
      bundles of perfumed letters and enamored sonnets. A hack politician, being
      deprived of bread by the loss of office, threw in his teeth, which
      happened to be false ones. The Rev. Sydney Smith&mdash;having voyaged
      across the Atlantic for that sole purpose&mdash;came up to the bonfire
      with a bitter grin and threw in certain repudiated bonds, fortified though
      they were with the broad seal of a sovereign state. A little boy of five
      years old, in the premature manliness of the present epoch, threw in his
      playthings; a college graduate, his diploma; an apothecary, ruined by the
      spread of homeopathy, his whole stock of drugs and medicines; a physician,
      his library; a parson, his old sermons; and a fine gentleman of the old
      school, his code of manners, which he had formerly written down for the
      benefit of the next generation. A widow, resolving on a second marriage,
      slyly threw in her dead husband&rsquo;s miniature. A young man, jilted by his
      mistress, would willingly have flung his own desperate heart into the
      flames, but could find no means to wrench it out of his bosom. An American
      author, whose works were neglected by the public, threw his pen and paper
      into the bonfire and betook himself to some less discouraging occupation.
      It somewhat startled me to overhear a number of ladies, highly respectable
      in appearance, proposing to fling their gowns and petticoats into the
      flames, and assume the garb, together with the manners, duties, offices,
      and responsibilities, of the opposite sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      What favor was accorded to this scheme I am unable to say, my attention
      being suddenly drawn to a poor, deceived, and half-delirious girl, who,
      exclaiming that she was the most worthless thing alive or dead, attempted
      to cast herself into the fire amid all that wrecked and broken trumpery of
      the world. A good man, however, ran to her rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Patience, my poor girl!&rdquo; said he, as he drew her back from the fierce
      embrace of the destroying angel. &ldquo;Be patient, and abide Heaven&rsquo;s will. So
      long as you possess a living soul, all may be restored to its first
      freshness. These things of matter and creations of human fantasy are fit
      for nothing but to be burned when once they have had their day; but your
      day is eternity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the wretched girl, whose frenzy seemed now to have sunk down
      into deep despondency, &ldquo;yes, and the sunshine is blotted out of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now rumored among the spectators that all the weapons and munitions
      of war were to be thrown into the bonfire with the exception of the
      world&rsquo;s stock of gunpowder, which, as the safest mode of disposing of it,
      had already been drowned in the sea. This intelligence seemed to awaken
      great diversity of opinion. The hopeful philanthropist esteemed it a token
      that the millennium was already come; while persons of another stamp, in
      whose view mankind was a breed of bulldogs, prophesied that all the old
      stoutness, fervor, nobleness, generosity, and magnanimity of the race
      would disappear,&mdash;these qualities, as they affirmed, requiring blood
      for their nourishment. They comforted themselves, however, in the belief
      that the proposed abolition of war was impracticable for any length of
      time together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it might, numberless great guns, whose thunder had long been
      the voice of battle,&mdash;the artillery of the Armada, the battering
      trains of Marlborough, and the adverse cannon of Napoleon and Wellington,&mdash;were
      trundled into the midst of the fire. By the continual addition of dry
      combustibles, it had now waxed so intense that neither brass nor iron
      could withstand it. It was wonderful to behold how these terrible
      instruments of slaughter melted away like playthings of wax. Then the
      armies of the earth wheeled around the mighty furnace, with their military
      music playing triumphant marches,&mdash;and flung in their muskets and
      swords. The standard-bearers, likewise, cast one look upward at their
      banners, all tattered with shot-holes and inscribed with the names of
      victorious fields; and, giving them a last flourish on the breeze, they
      lowered them into the flame, which snatched them upward in its rush
      towards the clouds. This ceremony being over, the world was left without a
      single weapon in its hands, except possibly a few old king&rsquo;s arms and
      rusty swords and other trophies of the Revolution in some of our State
      armories. And now the drums were beaten and the trumpets brayed all
      together, as a prelude to the proclamation of universal and eternal peace
      and the announcement that glory was no longer to be won by blood, but that
      it would henceforth be the contention of the human race to work out the
      greatest mutual good, and that beneficence, in the future annals of the
      earth, would claim the praise of valor. The blessed tidings were
      accordingly promulgated, and caused infinite rejoicings among those who
      had stood aghast at the horror and absurdity of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I saw a grim smile pass over the seared visage of a stately old
      commander,&mdash;by his war-worn figure and rich military dress, he might
      have been one of Napoleon&rsquo;s famous marshals,&mdash;who, with the rest of
      the world&rsquo;s soldiery, had just flung away the sword that had been familiar
      to his right hand for half a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! ay!&rdquo; grumbled he. &ldquo;Let them proclaim what they please; but, in the
      end, we shall find that all this foolery has only made more work for the
      armorers and cannon-founders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed I, in astonishment, &ldquo;do you imagine that the human
      race will ever so far return on the steps of its past madness as to weld
      another sword or cast another cannon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no need,&rdquo; observed, with a sneer, one who neither felt
      benevolence nor had faith in it. &ldquo;When Cain wished to slay his brother, he
      was at no loss for a weapon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; replied the veteran commander. &ldquo;If I am mistaken, so much
      the better; but in my opinion, without pretending to philosophize about
      the matter, the necessity of war lies far deeper than these honest
      gentlemen suppose. What! is there a field for all the petty disputes of
      individuals? and shall there be no great law court for the settlement of
      national difficulties? The battle-field is the only court where such suits
      can be tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, general,&rdquo; rejoined I, &ldquo;that, in this advanced stage of
      civilization, Reason and Philanthropy combined will constitute just such a
      tribunal as is requisite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I had forgotten that, indeed!&rdquo; said the old warrior, as he limped
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was now to be replenished with materials that had hitherto been
      considered of even greater importance to the well-being of society than
      the warlike munitions which we had already seen consumed. A body of
      reformers had travelled all over the earth in quest of the machinery by
      which the different nations were accustomed to inflict the punishment of
      death. A shudder passed through the multitude as these ghastly emblems
      were dragged forward. Even the flames seemed at first to shrink away,
      displaying the shape and murderous contrivance of each in a full blaze of
      light, which of itself was sufficient to convince mankind of the long and
      deadly error of human law. Those old implements of cruelty; those horrible
      monsters of mechanism; those inventions which it seemed to demand
      something worse than man&rsquo;s natural heart to contrive, and which had lurked
      in the dusky nooks of ancient prisons, the subject of terror-stricken
      legend,&mdash;were now brought forth to view. Headsmen&rsquo;s axes, with the
      rust of noble and royal blood upon them, and a vast collection of halters
      that had choked the breath of plebeian victims, were thrown in together. A
      shout greeted the arrival of the guillotine, which was thrust forward on
      the same wheels that had borne it from one to another of the bloodstained
      streets of Paris. But the loudest roar of applause went up, telling the
      distant sky of the triumph of the earth&rsquo;s redemption, when the gallows
      made its appearance. An ill-looking fellow, however, rushed forward, and,
      putting himself in the path of the reformers, bellowed hoarsely, and
      fought with brute fury to stay their progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was little matter of surprise, perhaps, that the executioner should
      thus do his best to vindicate and uphold the machinery by which he himself
      had his livelihood and worthier individuals their death; but it deserved
      special note that men of a far different sphere&mdash;even of that
      consecrated class in whose guardianship the world is apt to trust its
      benevolence&mdash;were found to take the hangman&rsquo;s view of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, my brethren!&rdquo; cried one of them. &ldquo;You are misled by a false
      philanthropy; you know not what you do. The gallows is a Heaven-ordained
      instrument. Bear it back, then, reverently, and set it up in its old
      place, else the world will fall to speedy ruin and desolation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Onward! onward!&rdquo; shouted a leader in the reform. &ldquo;Into the flames with
      the accursed instrument of man&rsquo;s bloody policy! How can human law
      inculcate benevolence and love while it persists in setting up the gallows
      as its chief symbol? One heave more, good friends, and the world will be
      redeemed from its greatest error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thousand hands, that nevertheless loathed the touch, now lent their
      assistance, and thrust the ominous burden far, far into the centre of the
      raging furnace. There its fatal and abhorred image was beheld, first
      black, then a red coal, then ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was well done!&rdquo; exclaimed I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was well done,&rdquo; replied, but with less enthusiasm than I
      expected, the thoughtful observer, who was still at my side,&mdash;&ldquo;well
      done, if the world be good enough for the measure. Death, however, is an
      idea that cannot easily be dispensed with in any condition between the
      primal innocence and that other purity and perfection which perchance we
      are destined to attain after travelling round the full circle; but, at all
      events, it is well that the experiment should now be tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too cold! too cold!&rdquo; impatiently exclaimed the young and ardent leader in
      this triumph. &ldquo;Let the heart have its voice here as well as the intellect.
      And as for ripeness, and as for progress, let mankind always do the
      highest, kindest, noblest thing that, at any given period, it has attained
      the perception of; and surely that thing cannot be wrong nor wrongly
      timed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I know not whether it were the excitement of the scene, or whether the
      good people around the bonfire were really growing more enlightened every
      instant; but they now proceeded to measures in the full length of which I
      was hardly prepared to keep them company. For instance, some threw their
      marriage certificates into the flames, and declared themselves candidates
      for a higher, holier, and more comprehensive union than that which had
      subsisted from the birth of time under the form of the connubial tie.
      Others hastened to the vaults of banks and to the coffers of the rich&mdash;all
      of which were opened to the first comer on this fated occasion&mdash;and
      brought entire bales of paper-money to enliven the blaze, and tons of coin
      to be melted down by its intensity. Henceforth, they said, universal
      benevolence, uncoined and exhaustless, was to be the golden currency of
      the world. At this intelligence the bankers and speculators in the stocks
      grew pale, and a pickpocket, who had reaped a rich harvest among the
      crowd, fell down in a deadly fainting fit. A few men of business burned
      their day-books and ledgers, the notes and obligations of their creditors,
      and all other evidences of debts due to themselves; while perhaps a
      somewhat larger number satisfied their zeal for reform with the sacrifice
      of any uncomfortable recollection of their own indebtment. There was then
      a cry that the period was arrived when the title-deeds of landed property
      should be given to the flames, and the whole soil of the earth revert to
      the public, from whom it had been wrongfully abstracted and most unequally
      distributed among individuals. Another party demanded that all written
      constitutions, set forms of government, legislative acts, statute-books,
      and everything else on which human invention had endeavored to stamp its
      arbitrary laws, should at once be destroyed, leaving the consummated world
      as free as the man first created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether any ultimate action was taken with regard to these propositions is
      beyond my knowledge; for, just then, some matters were in progress that
      concerned my sympathies more nearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See! see! What heaps of books and pamphlets!&rdquo; cried a fellow, who did not
      seem to be a lover of literature. &ldquo;Now we shall have a glorious blaze!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the thing!&rdquo; said a modern philosopher. &ldquo;Now we shall get rid
      of the weight of dead men&rsquo;s thought, which has hitherto pressed so heavily
      on the living intellect that it has been incompetent to any effectual
      self-exertion. Well done, my lads! Into the fire with them! Now you are
      enlightening the world indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is to become of the trade?&rdquo; cried a frantic bookseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, by all means, let them accompany their merchandise,&rdquo; coolly observed
      an author. &ldquo;It will be a noble funeral-pile!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The truth was, that the human race had now reached a stage of progress so
      far beyond what the wisest and wittiest men of former ages had ever
      dreamed of, that it would have been a manifest absurdity to allow the
      earth to be any longer encumbered with their poor achievements in the
      literary line. Accordingly a thorough and searching investigation had
      swept the booksellers&rsquo; shops, hawkers&rsquo; stands, public and private
      libraries, and even the little book-shelf by the country fireside, and had
      brought the world&rsquo;s entire mass of printed paper, bound or in sheets, to
      swell the already mountain bulk of our illustrious bonfire. Thick, heavy
      folios, containing the labors of lexicographers, commentators, and
      encyclopedists, were flung in, and, falling among the embers with a leaden
      thump, smouldered away to ashes like rotten wood. The small, richly gilt
      French tomes of the last age, with the hundred volumes of Voltaire among
      them, went off in a brilliant shower of sparkles and little jets of flame;
      while the current literature of the same nation burned red and blue, and
      threw an infernal light over the visages of the spectators, converting
      them all to the aspect of party-colored fiends. A collection of German
      stories emitted a scent of brimstone. The English standard authors made
      excellent fuel, generally exhibiting the properties of sound oak logs.
      Milton&rsquo;s works, in particular, sent up a powerful blaze, gradually
      reddening into a coal, which promised to endure longer than almost any
      other material of the pile. From Shakespeare there gushed a flame of such
      marvellous splendor that men shaded their eyes as against the sun&rsquo;s
      meridian glory; nor even when the works of his own elucidators were flung
      upon him did he cease to flash forth a dazzling radiance from beneath the
      ponderous heap. It is my belief that he is still blazing as fervidly as
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could a poet but light a lamp at that glorious flame,&rdquo; remarked I, &ldquo;he
      might then consume the midnight oil to some good purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the very thing which modern poets have been too apt to do, or at
      least to attempt,&rdquo; answered a critic. &ldquo;The chief benefit to be expected
      from this conflagration of past literature undoubtedly is, that writers
      will henceforth be compelled to light their lamps at the sun or stars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they can reach so high,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but that task requires a giant, who
      may afterwards distribute the light among inferior men. It is not every
      one that can steal the fire from heaven like Prometheus; but, when once he
      had done the deed, a thousand hearths were kindled by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It amazed me much to observe how indefinite was the proportion between the
      physical mass of any given author and the property of brilliant and
      long-continued combustion. For instance, there was not a quarto volume of
      the last century&mdash;nor, indeed, of the present&mdash;that could
      compete in that particular with a child&rsquo;s little gilt-covered book,
      containing _Mother Goose&rsquo;s Melodies_. _The Life and Death of Tom Thumb_
      outlasted the biography of Marlborough. An epic, indeed a dozen of them,
      was converted to white ashes before the single sheet of an old ballad was
      half consumed. In more than one case, too, when volumes of applauded verse
      proved incapable of anything better than a stifling smoke, an unregarded
      ditty of some nameless bard&mdash;perchance in the corner of a newspaper&mdash;soared
      up among the stars with a flame as brilliant as their own. Speaking of the
      properties of flame, methought Shelley&rsquo;s poetry emitted a purer light than
      almost any other productions of his day, contrasting beautifully with the
      fitful and lurid gleams and gushes of black vapor that flashed and eddied
      from the volumes of Lord Byron. As for Tom Moore, some of his songs
      diffused an odor like a burning pastil.
    </p>
    <p>
      I felt particular interest in watching the combustion of American authors,
      and scrupulously noted by my watch the precise number of moments that
      changed most of them from shabbily printed books to indistinguishable
      ashes. It would be invidious, however, if not perilous, to betray these
      awful secrets; so that I shall content myself with observing that it was
      not invariably the writer most frequent in the public mouth that made the
      most splendid appearance in the bonfire. I especially remember that a
      great deal of excellent inflammability was exhibited in a thin volume of
      poems by Ellery Channing; although, to speak the truth, there were certain
      portions that hissed and spluttered in a very disagreeable fashion. A
      curious phenomenon occurred in reference to several writers, native as
      well as foreign. Their books, though of highly respectable figure, instead
      of bursting into a blaze or even smouldering out their substance in smoke,
      suddenly melted away in a manner that proved them to be ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it be no lack of modesty to mention my own works, it must here be
      confessed that I looked for them with fatherly interest, but in vain. Too
      probably they were changed to vapor by the first action of the heat; at
      best, I can only hope that, in their quiet way, they contributed a
      glimmering spark or two to the splendor of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! and woe is me!&rdquo; thus bemoaned himself a heavy-looking gentleman in
      green spectacles. &ldquo;The world is utterly ruined, and there is nothing to
      live for any longer. The business of my life is snatched from me. Not a
      volume to be had for love or money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; remarked the sedate observer beside me, &ldquo;is a bookworm,&mdash;one
      of those men who are born to gnaw dead thoughts. His clothes, you see, are
      covered with the dust of libraries. He has no inward fountain of ideas;
      and, in good earnest, now that the old stock is abolished, I do not see
      what is to become of the poor fellow. Have you no word of comfort for
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said I to the desperate bookworm, &ldquo;is not nature better
      than a book? Is not the human heart deeper than any system of philosophy?
      Is not life replete with more instruction than past observers have found
      it possible to write down in maxims? Be of good cheer. The great book of
      Time is still spread wide open before us; and, if we read it aright, it
      will be to us a volume of eternal truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, my books, my books, my precious printed books!&rdquo; reiterated the forlorn
      bookworm. &ldquo;My only reality was a bound volume; and now they will not leave
      me even a shadowy pamphlet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the last remnant of the literature of all the ages was now
      descending upon the blazing heap in the shape of a cloud of pamphlets from
      the press of the New World. These likewise were consumed in the twinkling
      of an eye, leaving the earth, for the first time since the days of Cadmus,
      free from the plague of letters,&mdash;an enviable field for the authors
      of the next generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and does anything remain to be done?&rdquo; inquired I, somewhat
      anxiously. &ldquo;Unless we set fire to the earth itself, and then leap boldly
      off into infinite space, I know not that we can carry reform to any
      farther point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are vastly mistaken, my good friend,&rdquo; said the observer. &ldquo;Believe me,
      the fire will not be allowed to settle down without the addition of fuel
      that will startle many persons who have lent a willing hand thus far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless there appeared to be a relaxation of effort for a little
      time, during which, probably, the leaders of the movement were considering
      what should be done next. In the interval, a philosopher threw his theory
      into the flames,&mdash;a sacrifice which, by those who knew how to
      estimate it, was pronounced the most remarkable that had yet been made.
      The combustion, however, was by no means brilliant. Some indefatigable
      people, scorning to take a moment&rsquo;s ease, now employed themselves in
      collecting all the withered leaves and fallen boughs of the forest, and
      thereby recruited the bonfire to a greater height than ever. But this was
      mere by-play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here comes the fresh fuel that I spoke of,&rdquo; said my companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To my astonishment the persons who now advanced into the vacant space
      around the mountain fire bore surplices and other priestly garments,
      mitres, crosiers, and a confusion of Popish and Protestant emblems with
      which it seemed their purpose to consummate the great act of faith.
      Crosses from the spires of old cathedrals were cast upon the heap with as
      little remorse as if the reverence of centuries passing in long array
      beneath the lofty towers had not looked up to them as the holiest of
      symbols. The font in which infants were consecrated to God, the
      sacramental vessels whence piety received the hallowed draught, were given
      to the same destruction. Perhaps it most nearly touched my heart to see
      among these devoted relics fragments of the humble communion-tables and
      undecorated pulpits which I recognized as having been torn from the
      meeting-houses of New England. Those simple edifices might have been
      permitted to retain all of sacred embellishment that their Puritan
      founders had bestowed, even though the mighty structure of St. Peter&rsquo;s had
      sent its spoils to the fire of this terrible sacrifice. Yet I felt that
      these were but the externals of religion, and might most safely be
      relinquished by spirits that best knew their deep significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All is well,&rdquo; said I, cheerfully. &ldquo;The wood-paths shall be the aisles of
      our cathedral, the firmament itself shall be its ceiling. What needs an
      earthly roof between the Deity and his worshippers? Our faith can well
      afford to lose all the drapery that even the holiest men have thrown
      around it, and be only the more sublime in its simplicity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said my companion; &ldquo;but will they pause here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doubt implied in his question was well founded. In the general
      destruction of books already described, a holy volume, that stood apart
      from the catalogue of human literature, and yet, in one sense, was at its
      head, had been spared. But the Titan of innovation,&mdash;angel or fiend,
      double in his nature, and capable of deeds befitting both characters,&mdash;at
      first shaking down only the old and rotten shapes of things, had now, as
      it appeared, laid his terrible hand upon the main pillars which supported
      the whole edifice of our moral and spiritual state. The inhabitants of the
      earth had grown too enlightened to define their faith within a form of
      words, or to limit the spiritual by any analogy to our material existence.
      Truths which the heavens trembled at were now but a fable of the world&rsquo;s
      infancy. Therefore, as the final sacrifice of human error, what else
      remained to be thrown upon the embers of that awful pile, except the book
      which, though a celestial revelation to past ages, was but a voice from a
      lower sphere as regarded the present race of man? It was done! Upon the
      blazing heap of falsehood and worn-out truth&mdash;things that the earth
      had never needed, or had ceased to need, or had grown childishly weary of&mdash;fell
      the ponderous church Bible, the great old volume that had lain so long on
      the cushion of the pulpit, and whence the pastor&rsquo;s solemn voice had given
      holy utterance on so many a Sabbath day. There, likewise, fell the family
      Bible, which the long-buried patriarch had read to his children,&mdash;in
      prosperity or sorrow, by the fireside and in the summer shade of trees,&mdash;and
      had bequeathed downward as the heirloom of generations. There fell the
      bosom Bible, the little volume that had been the soul&rsquo;s friend of some
      sorely tried child of dust, who thence took courage, whether his trial
      were for life or death, steadfastly confronting both in the strong
      assurance of immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these were flung into the fierce and riotous blaze; and then a mighty
      wind came roaring across the plain with a desolate howl, as if it were the
      angry lamentation of the earth for the loss of heaven&rsquo;s sunshine; and it
      shook the gigantic pyramid of flame and scattered the cinders of
      half-consumed abominations around upon the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is terrible!&rdquo; said I, feeling that my check grew pale, and seeing a
      like change in the visages about me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be of good courage yet,&rdquo; answered the man with whom I had so often
      spoken. He continued to gaze steadily at the spectacle with a singular
      calmness, as if it concerned him merely as an observer. &ldquo;Be of good
      courage, nor yet exult too much; for there is far less both of good and
      evil in the effect of this bonfire than the world might be willing to
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; exclaimed I, impatiently. &ldquo;Has it not consumed
      everything? Has it not swallowed up or melted down every human or divine
      appendage of our mortal state that had substance enough to be acted on by
      fire? Will there be anything left us to-morrow morning better or worse
      than a heap of embers and ashes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuredly there will,&rdquo; said my grave friend. &ldquo;Come hither to-morrow
      morning, or whenever the combustible portion of the pile shall be quite
      burned out, and you will find among the ashes everything really valuable
      that you have seen cast into the flames. Trust me, the world of to-morrow
      will again enrich itself with the gold and diamonds which have been cast
      off by the world of today. Not a truth is destroyed nor buried so deep
      among the ashes but it will be raked up at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was a strange assurance. Yet I felt inclined to credit it, the more
      especially as I beheld among the wallowing flames a copy of the Holy
      Scriptures, the pages of which, instead of being blackened into tinder,
      only assumed a more dazzling whiteness as the fingermarks of human
      imperfection were purified away. Certain marginal notes and commentaries,
      it is true, yielded to the intensity of the fiery test, but without
      detriment to the smallest syllable that had flamed from the pen of
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there is the proof of what you say,&rdquo; answered I, turning to the
      observer; &ldquo;but if only what is evil can feel the action of the fire, then,
      surely, the conflagration has been of inestimable utility. Yet, if I
      understand aright, you intimate a doubt whether the world&rsquo;s expectation of
      benefit would be realized by it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to the talk of these worthies,&rdquo; said he, pointing to a group in
      front of the blazing pile; &ldquo;possibly they may teach you something useful,
      without intending it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The persons whom he indicated consisted of that brutal and most earthy
      figure who had stood forth so furiously in defence of the gallows,&mdash;the
      hangman, in short,&mdash;together with the last thief and the last
      murderer, all three of whom were clustered about the last toper. The
      latter was liberally passing the brandy bottle, which he had rescued from
      the general destruction of wines and spirits. This little convivial party
      seemed at the lowest pitch of despondency, as considering that the
      purified world must needs be utterly unlike the sphere that they had
      hitherto known, and therefore but a strange and desolate abode for
      gentlemen of their kidney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best counsel for all of us is,&rdquo; remarked the hangman, &ldquo;that, as soon
      as we have finished the last drop of liquor, I help you, my three friends,
      to a comfortable end upon the nearest tree, and then hang myself on the
      same bough. This is no world for us any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poh, poh, my good fellows!&rdquo; said a dark-complexioned personage, who now
      joined the group,&mdash;his complexion was indeed fearfully dark, and his
      eyes glowed with a redder light than that of the bonfire; &ldquo;be not so cast
      down, my dear friends; you shall see good days yet. There is one thing
      that these wiseacres have forgotten to throw into the fire, and without
      which all the rest of the conflagration is just nothing at all; yes,
      though they had burned the earth itself to a cinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo; eagerly demanded the last murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What but the human heart itself?&rdquo; said the dark-visaged stranger, with a
      portentous grin. &ldquo;And, unless they hit upon some method of purifying that
      foul cavern, forth from it will reissue all the shapes of wrong and misery&mdash;the
      same old shapes or worse ones&mdash;which they have taken such a vast deal
      of trouble to consume to ashes. I have stood by this livelong night and
      laughed in my sleeve at the whole business. O, take my word for it, it
      will be the old world yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brief conversation supplied me with a theme for lengthened thought.
      How sad a truth, if true it were, that man&rsquo;s age-long endeavor for
      perfection had served only to render him the mockery of the evil
      principle, from the fatal circumstance of an error at the very root of the
      matter! The heart, the heart, there was the little yet boundless sphere
      wherein existed the original wrong of which the crime and misery of this
      outward world were merely types. Purify that inward sphere, and the many
      shapes of evil that haunt the outward, and which now seem almost our only
      realities, will turn to shadowy phantoms and vanish of their own accord;
      but if we go no deeper than the intellect, and strive, with merely that
      feeble instrument, to discern and rectify what is wrong, our whole
      accomplishment will be a dream, so unsubstantial that it matters little
      whether the bonfire, which I have so faithfully described, were what we
      choose to call a real event and a flame that would scorch the finger, or
      only a phosphoric radiance and a parable of my own brain.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
